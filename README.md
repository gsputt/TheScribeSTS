The Spell Scribe: A character designed around modular spells, using Spell Effects and Spell Modifiers to create custom spells. 

Class Identity: Combo heavy, modular, easy hybridization. Rewards knowledge of the broader mechanics of Slay the Spire and proper ordering. 

This mod is currently a work in progress. Balance concerns can be directed either to ComingVirus who is working on the design and playtesting of this character, or to Left Click the original creator of this character.

Current Focus: Fleshing out the basic deck so it makes more sense. Additional implementation for scaling for non-big spell archetypes.

Cards: 58/70 + 5 Basic Cards + 1 Special card
Relics: 1 Starter Relic. 2 Uncommon Relics. Additional Relics in development.
Card Art: ?/70 + 5 Basic + 1 Special

Character has a sprite and is animated
Missing character art: Corpse, shoulder 1, shoulder 2.
